The liva-lang is a work in progress project of implementing
my own programming language. 

I was always fascinated in how programming language work under the hood.
Sometimes working with a interpreter and/or compiler is hard, I couldn't
image, how complicated and complex the implementation has to be!

I therefore started my own studies and designed a language, which I would
like to use myself. The final goal is a usable language for normal scripting
task aswell as something a data scientist or machine learning engineer would 
like to use.

Here a little snippet of what the language looks like:

```lua
fun collatz(n)
    println(n)
    if n == 1 do
        return 1
    end
    
    if n % 2 == 0 do
        return collatz(n / 2)
    else 
        return collatz(3 * n + 1)
    end

    return
end

collatz(256)
```
